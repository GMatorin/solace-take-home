Great take-home project! There’s still a lot that could be done — finishing pagination, improving the UI, and polishing overall performance. One thing I wish was included is a prioritized list of features and updates the team would like to see in this project.

### 1. Server-Side Search  
Move filtering logic to the backend to handle large datasets efficiently and reduce client-side load.

### 2. Enhanced Pagination  
Support total record counts and page navigation with a clearer UI, remembering filters across pages.

### 3. UI/UX Polish  
Improve spacing, responsiveness, and accessibility; add visual feedback and more user-friendly table layouts.

### 4. Backend Robustness  
Add better error handling, data validation, and database indexing to ensure reliable, scalable performance.

### 5. Testing & Developer Experience  
Introduce automated testing, linting, and clearer setup scripts to make the project easier to maintain and extend.
